The game starts off with a block that the player can move up, down left and right
At the same time another block appears on screen that is a different color but can not be moved
Your goal is to get as many of the fixed blocks as you can
For every block you get, your "snake" will grow twice the size it was before
You die by hitting a wall on the top, left, right or bottom sides of your screen and also if you go in on yourself
