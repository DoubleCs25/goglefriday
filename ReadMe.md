You start of with a block that can move up, down left and right
Also, at the same time another block appears on screen that is a different color but can not be moved
Your goal is to get as many as the fixed blocks as you can
For every block you get, your "snake" will grow twice the size it was before
You die by hitting a wall on the top, left, right and bottom sides of your screen and if you go in on yourself
